## What is it?

When you assign a `view-transition-name` to an element that is larger than the viewport, the View Transition API adds a default animation to the `::view-transition-group()` of the element that makes instant scrolling look like smooth scrolling. The Cam-Shaft bumps and nudges your view transition pseudo-elements back into place to avoid that pseudo-smooth-scrolling effect.
